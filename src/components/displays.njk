  <p>Displays are a key component of many UltiBlox projects, providing a clear and effective way to communicate information visually. Whether you’re building a simple sensor readout or a more complex data display, UltiBlox displays integrate smoothly into your modular project setup. They allow you to add valuable visual feedback, helping to bring your projects to life by presenting important data in an accessible way.</p>

  <h3>Designed for Flexibility</h3>
  <p>UltiBlox displays are available in different types to suit a range of project needs—whether you require a compact OLED for detailed visuals or an LCD for larger, easier-to-read text. Each display module is built with consistent function signatures, allowing them to be easily interchanged as your project evolves.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Interchangeable Display Options:</strong> Choose from display types like OLED or LCD that can be swapped by updating a configuration setting. This adaptability makes it easy to adjust your project without significant code changes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Simple Integration</h3>
  <p><strong>Modular Design:</strong> The displays are designed to be modular and straightforward to upgrade. You can easily swap out one display for another by adjusting configurations, reducing effort when your project evolves.</p>
  <p><strong>Adaptable Outputs:</strong> UltiBlox displays offer options for text, numerical data, or even simple graphics, giving you the flexibility to choose the right solution for your application.</p>

  <h3>Key Benefits</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Versatile Visual Feedback:</strong> Easily add displays to show status updates, sensor readings, or other key information your project needs to communicate.</li>
    <li><strong>Minimal Configuration Changes:</strong> Swapping displays involves only minor adjustments, keeping modifications simple and ensuring quick adaptability.</li>
    <li><strong>Consistent Integration:</strong> All display modules are designed to work seamlessly with other UltiBlox components, maintaining a consistent and modular workflow.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Use Cases</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sensor Readouts:</strong> Use an OLED display to show sensor data clearly, ideal for compact setups requiring real-time monitoring.</li>
    <li><strong>Project Status Indicators:</strong> Utilize an LCD display for larger, easy-to-read outputs that help track system status or provide simple alerts.</li>
