  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>The enclosures are the building blocks of the UltiBlox system, designed to fit together seamlessly through a standardized modular approach. Each enclosure is based on multiples of 5 cm, making them easy to mix, match, and stack. This consistent sizing provides a straightforward way to expand projects, ensuring everything fits together effortlessly.</p>

  <h3>The Modular Concept</h3>
  <p>The core idea is adaptability and compatibility. Each enclosure follows standard dimensions—5x5 cm, 10x10 cm, or 15x10 cm—allowing easy combination without size mismatches.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Multiple Sizes:</strong> Available in 5-5-5, 10-10-5, 15-10-5 sizes, adhering to a 5 cm increment system. This makes the design process simple and scalable.</li>
    <li><strong>Stackable and Swappable:</strong> Tops, bases, and sides are interchangeable, enabling vertical or horizontal builds.</li>
    <li><strong>M3 Screw Standard:</strong> M3 screw holes arranged in a 2x2 pattern, spaced 20 mm apart, are repeated along each side. The 15-10-5 enclosure, for example, has three connection points along each side, plus slots for cable management.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Flexibility by Design</h3>
  <p><strong>Standardized Connection Points:</strong> Multiple access points and mounting holes for components like displays and sensors ensure flexibility.</p>
  <p><strong>Cable Management:</strong> Built-in slots allow for neat cable routing, keeping builds organized.</p>

  <h3>Benefits of the Modular System</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Easy Expansion:</strong> Adding new modules or expanding is simple due to the standardized sizing.</li>
    <li><strong>Customizable Layouts:</strong> Combine different enclosure sizes for custom layouts—compact or extended, the enclosures adapt to your needs.</li>
    <li><strong>No Specialized Tools Required:</strong> Designed for makers, with standard screws and simple attachments for easy assembly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Use Cases</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stacked Builds:</strong> Stack enclosures, such as a 10-10-5 base with a display top for feedback.</li>
    <li><strong>Horizontal Combinations:</strong> Combine sensor units with indicator modules side by side.</li>
    <li><strong>Modular Prototyping:</strong> Quickly swap different modules to prototype complex systems.</li>
  </ul>
