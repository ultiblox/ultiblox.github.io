<h2>Libraries</h2>
<p>Get into the code that drives it all. Our libraries provide the magic that makes every piece of hardware come alive.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Ultiblocks libraries are designed for simplicity and interchangeability, just like the physical enclosures. Each library fits seamlessly into your project, allowing you to swap and adjust components with minimal effort. Adding new functionality is often as easy as changing a single configuration.</p>

<h3>Modular and Interchangeable by Design</h3>
<p>Ultiblocks libraries are built with identical function signatures, making them easy to replace or upgrade without major rewrites. For example, DisplayValueLCD and DisplayValueOLED can be swapped by adjusting one configuration. The SensorAnalog library follows the same approach, allowing quick integration of new sensor types, all while maintaining consistency and ease of use.</p>

<h3>Mix-and-Match Flexibility</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consistent Function Signatures:</strong> Libraries use consistent function signatures, making it simple to mix and match components without compatibility issues.</li>
  <li><strong>Simple Configuration:</strong> Swapping components usually involves changing a single configuration or precompiler directive, keeping everything accessible for all skill levels.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Benefits of a Modular Software System</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Effortless Upgrades:</strong> Upgrade sensors or displays by simply changing a library reference or configuration.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduced Complexity:</strong> Learn one library and easily apply your knowledge across others, minimizing the learning curve.</li>
  <li><strong>Scalable Projects:</strong> Easily add new features by integrating the right library and updating the configuration.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Use Cases</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Swapping Displays:</strong> Switch between LCD and OLED displays by adjusting a configuration setting.</li>
  <li><strong>Sensor Expansion:</strong> Add new sensors like temperature or humidity by including a compatible library and updating the configuration.</li>
</ul>

<p>The modular approach of Ultiblocks libraries ensures flexibility and ease of use. By making them interchangeable and simple to configure, makers can focus more on building and less on troubleshooting.</p>
